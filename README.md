# PreEnvDrop
<p>This codebase is for the Environment Drop method with Backtranslation and Pre-trained with GloVe Embeddings. This is a part of one of the experiments in the thesis titled "Language Pre-Training and Auxiliary Tasks for Vision 
and Language Navigation"</p>
<p> This thesis analyzes the failures of the previously used Environment Drop method with Back translation and investigates what happens when pre-trained embeddings, as well as auxiliary tasks, are utilized with it. In particular, it proposes an augmentation to the architecture for the Vision and language Navigation task with pretrained language tokens and a navigator with reasoning to oversee the progress and to co-ground vision and language rather than to only use temporal attention mechanism. The underlying base architecture on which the modifications have been implemented has been a highly successful method and uses the Environment Drop method with Back translation. While results with the modified architecture and proposed improvements did not show a significant increase in the success rate of the chosen base architecture, the analysis of the results has provided valuable insights to help determine the direction of potential further research. <p>
